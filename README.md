# quiz

This is a very, very rudimentary attempt at a quiz application. 
A fair amount of the structure has been gleaned from various online tutorials and mashed together to make something 
that's very frustrating to use. 

The hope is to build it out from its basic state to include the following features:

- a timer that begins very innocuously when the start button is clicked but increases in size and precision with every incorrect answer
- after some arbitrary amount of wrong answers, an alert appears on the page that suggests that a randomly generated phone number is being called 
  and a 'stop call' button either appears and is not functioning or disappears from the page completely. a call-up sample can be used until this is functioning 
- with every incorrect answer the background becomes more and more assertive (but still well within the bounds of the Harding test parameters)


-also just need to get something working in a basic way to present to a group of people two days from now so
